- The addon will export data for all characters whos profession data it has 'seen'. For the addon to 'see' the data initially, you must log in to that character and open a profession window. You can then either upload or log to a different character. For later uploads the new item will always be seen when added to your spellbook and you can then upload at your leisure.
