Tradies

WHAT THE ADDON IS FOR:
	This addon will automatically reply to any '?tradies' requests in whispers, party, guild or global channels.
	
  Based on your professions, tradies will reply with any item that matches.
	For example, if someone types '?tradies mong' in guild chat, you'll automatically send him a whisper if you're an alchemist with the Mongoose recipe.")
	Likewise, if you're in a city and are looking for someone who can do the Crusader enchant, you'll be able to do '/2 ?tradies crusader' to get replies
  from any enchanter with that enchant (and the addon)

	Auto-replies can be toggled on and off by typing '/tradies autoreply'
  
  Tradies can also collect what recipes/patterns/enchants/etc you have and let you upload that information to the WarcraftRatings website
  The Website will then allow you to find who on your realm can create that rare item you're after
  The listings can be found at https://warcraftratings.com/tradies
